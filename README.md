# BC Advisor Web Scraper Database 

This is the design for the PostgreSQL Database to hold data for the BC Advisor Web Scraper

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

None. We will be installing PostgreSQL and its dependencies 

## Installation

### PostgreSQL Installation

Download and install the version of PostgreSQL 12 that corresponds with your operating system. For this, we will be accepting all default values.
* [PostgreSQL Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
Validate your installation by running a basic SQL query inside the  PostgreSQL shell
* Open the SQL shell (psql)
* Select the default options 
* Run the following command
```
SELECT version()
```

### pgAdmin Installation (optional)
Download and install the version of pgAdmin that corresponds with your operating system. This step is optional but it adds an easy to use GUI to the PostgreSQL server. For this, we will be accepting all default values.
